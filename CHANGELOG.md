[big_fury]SiZiOUS was here, since v0.6 core (http://sbibuilder.shorturl.com/)
kRYPT_ where are you, man...?

Changes :

- Fixed : Renamed '-scan' command to '-sega'. It scans a BMP image to check if it'll 
  convert to a MR image OK meaning, being able to "fit in a normal IP.BIN" 
  and it being within the size, resolution, and depth (24-bit BMP) limit, 
  as well as check how many colors there are in the image.

- Fixed : Use '-scan' switch to check BMP image to check if it'll convert to a 
  MR image OK.

- Added : Relative paths are allowed now (such ".\HELLO\MYFRIEND.BMP", or "..\..\DC\GOOD\".
